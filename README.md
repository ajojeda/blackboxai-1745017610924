# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application that utilizes Express.js for building web applications and includes several features such as authentication, logging, and rate limiting. This application provides a foundational structure for developing user-centric applications with a focus on security and performance.

## Installation
To get started with User Workspace, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd user-workspace

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the application and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using JWT.
- **Password Encryption**: Securely store passwords using the bcrypt library.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of your application with request limiting.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use `.env` files to manage environment variables with dotenv.
- **Logging**: Configure logging with winston for better diagnostics.

## Dependencies
This project includes the following dependencies listed in `package.json`:

- **bcrypt**: Used for hashing passwords.
- **cookie-parser**: Parse Cookie header and populate `req.cookies`.
- **dotenv**: Load environment variables from .env file.
- **express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **express-rate-limit**: Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js.

To install all dependencies, just run `npm install`, which will install the packages listed above as well as their dependencies.
