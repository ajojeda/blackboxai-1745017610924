# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application designed to manage user authentication and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It leverages the Express framework to implement a fast and minimalist backend suitable for various web applications.

   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your environment variables. You can refer to `.env.example` for formatting.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /login**: This endpoint is used for user login.
- **GET /user**: This endpoint retrieves user details based on the provided JWT.
- Additional endpoints can be implemented based on your requirements.

Make sure to include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

## Features
- User authentication using JWT for session management.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Environment variable management using dotenv.
- Logging with Winston for better diagnostics.
